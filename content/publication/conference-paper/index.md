abstract: Given the challenge of estimating or calculating quantities of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in developing countries, this article focuses on predicting the WEEE generated by Cameroonian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that are engaged in ISO 14001:2015 initiatives and consume electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) to enhance their performance and profitability. The methodology employed an exploratory approach involving the application of general equilibrium theory (GET) to contextualize the study and generate relevant parameters for deploying the random forest regression learning algorithm for predictions. Machine learning was applied to 80% of the samples for training, while simulation was conducted on the remaining 20% of samples based on quantities of EEE utilized over a specific period, utilization rates, repair rates, and average lifespans. The results demonstrate that the model’s predicted values are significantly close to the actual quantities of generated WEEE, and the model’s performance was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and yielding satisfactory results. Based on this model, both companies and stakeholders can set realistic objectives for managing companies’ WEEE, fostering sustainable socio-environmental practices.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this study, the city of Douala in Cameroon was chosen as the place of study. It is located on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, at the bottom of the Gulf of Guinea, and at the mouth of the Wouri River.
