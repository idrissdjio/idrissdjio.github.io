      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
         I am a graduate researcher in the HIRO Lab at CU Boulder, where my research centers on improving human-robot collaboration using advanced machine learning and robotics methods. My work applies both qualitative and quantitative techniques to create adaptable, responsive interactions between humans and robotic systems.

         This research contributes to the development of systems that allow robots to work more naturally and effectively with humans, particularly in collaborative and assistive scenarios. I aim to bridge the gap between human intentions and robotic responses, making technology more accessible and effective.

         Please reach out to collaborate 😃
